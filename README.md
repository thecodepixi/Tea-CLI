## TeaLI

This is a CLI app built in Ruby as a portfolio project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering curriculum. 

The app utilizes the Adagio Teas website (www.adagio.com). On start up the app will scrape the Adagio website for some basic tea info. 

Once finished scraping the user will be prompted to make one of three choices: browse all available tea by category, search by ingredient, or receive a surprise tea. 

***Heads Up:*** The "search by ingredient" option requires additional loading time during which all teas will be scraped for ingredient information, in order to allow the user to search for their desired ingredient. Some great options to search for: cinnamon, hibiscus, apple, chocolate, and vanilla. 

### Installing the TeaLI:

To install TeaLI, open your terminal and enter the following command: 

    gem install TeaLI

### Running the TeaLI:

To run the TeaLI application simply type `TeaLI` into your terminal 

### Navtigating the TeaLI:

At start up, you will be presented with 3 options. Type the number of your chosen option and press `ENTER`. 

If you would like to exit the TeaLI app at anytime, simply type `back` until you return to the main menu, and then type `exit` . 

After completing each search process, the user will once again be presented with the main menu options to continue to use the app or `exit` depending on their preference.
